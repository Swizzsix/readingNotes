### Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
#### SUMMARY: 
    - ""The browser represents the page using a DOM tree""
    - "DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes."
    - "You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or by using CSS selector syntax"
    - "whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodelist"
    - "From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manitpulation techniques."
    -"An element node can contain multple text nodes and child elements that are siblines of each other"
    -"In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent. (and is a popular reason for using JQUIERY)"
    -"Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree"
