## Domain Modeling
    -OBJECT ORIENTED MODEL
    - Property/Data/Type
    - "When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors."
    - "Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties."
    - "Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well."
    - "Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function."
    -"Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside."
    - "Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside."

## Jon Duckett JS Book
### Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
#### SUMMARY: 
    - "functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task."
    -"functions can take parameters(information required to do their job) and may return a value"
    -"an object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you"
    -"in an object variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object."
    -"web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window"
    -"javascript also has several built in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts"
    -"arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other)"
