## Jon Duckett HTML book:
### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
### SUMMARY
    - "the new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure"
    - "The new elements provice clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements)"
    - "older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements"
    - "to make html5 elements work in internet explorer 8 (an older version of IE) extra javascript is needed which is available free from google"
