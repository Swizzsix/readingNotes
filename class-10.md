### JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
    - EXECUTION CONTEXTS = Global/function/EVAL 
    - VARIABLE SCOPE = GGlobal scope/function level scope
    - THE STACK "The javascript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. when a statemenet needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the current task"
    - Executing context and hoisting 1. prepare 2. execute
    - scope
### SUMMARY:
    - "If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, yo u are more likely to find the error in your code"
    - "debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction."
    - "the console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error"
    - "javascript has 7 different types of errors. each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number an gives a description of the error."
    - "if you know that you make get an error, you can hangle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your user helpful feedback"
