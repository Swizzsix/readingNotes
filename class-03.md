## HTML Jon Duckett
### Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
- ol/ul = ordered list/unordered list li = list item 
- nested lists
<ul>
  <li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <li>
    <ul>
<ul>
- ordered lists used numbers while unordered lists use bullets 

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
#### SUMMARY: 
- CSS treats each HTML element as its own box  
- border margin padding
- top right bottom left
- border radius em
- "Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements"
- "Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. for example, the font-family property sets the choice of font and the value arial specifies Arial as the preffered typeface."
- "CSS rules usually appear in a seperate document, although they may appear within an HTML page."

## JS Jon Duckett
### Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
- "An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't jsut store one value; it stores a list of values."

let colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];
0 white
1 black
2 custom

colors [2] = 'biege';
let el = document.getElementById('colors');

el.textContent = colors [2];

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
