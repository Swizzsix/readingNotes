## HTML Jon Duckett
### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)

    - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE root folder

### Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
#### SUMMARY: 
    - "css treats HTML element as if it is in itts own box. This will either be a block level box or an inline box"
    - Normal Flow = every block element new line
    - relative positioning = moves position relative to normal flow
    - absolute = taken out of normal flow and absolute to block element
    - Fixed = in relation to browser window
    - float = take element in normal flow and place as far to left or right of containing element as possible
    - FIXED WIDTH LAYOUTS = greater control of liquid elements + size of image will always stay the same DISADVANTAGES = large gaps look smaller with higher resolution screen and more verticle space.
    - LIQUID LAYOURS = pages expand to fit entire page of layout + if user has small window can contract to fit it ithout user having to scroll - resolution problems too wide
